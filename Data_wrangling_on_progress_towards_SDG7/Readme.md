## By Hafsah Anibaba

<b>This project is and analysis on global progress toward acheiving all the the set targets towards SDG7.<br>
    Sustainable Development Goal 7(SDG7) calls for "affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all" by 2030. Its 3 core targets are:
    * Ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services.
    * Increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.
    * Double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency
    The targets of this goal.

#### Methodology 
  - I extracted data on indicators I need to analyse the progress towards the goal  so far.
  - I cleaned the data and also made observations of country that had years of no record and countries that had no missing data
        ![Countries missing 10 consecutive years of data](https://github.com/Hafsah2020/analysis-on-sdg7/blob/main/Data_wrangling_on_progress_towards_SDG7/visualisations/visualisation_from_wrangling/7_1/missing%2010%20years.gif)
        ![countries with at least a year of missing data](https://github.com/Hafsah2020/analysis-on-sdg7/blob/main/Data_wrangling_on_progress_towards_SDG7/visualisations/visualisation_from_wrangling/7_1/missing%20at%20least%20a%20year.gif)
